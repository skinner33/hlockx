This is a rewrite of lockx [0] as i experienced some segfaults with it and
fixing those bugs didn't seem feasible.

hlockx must be owned by root and have setuid-bit set.

Configure with --flags="def_slock" to make it behave like slock per default.

Configure with --flags="use_pam" to use PAM for the authentication. This makes
it unnecessary to set the setuid-bit and having the executable owned by root.
Although authentication with PAM is slow, so slock behaviour should be used.
